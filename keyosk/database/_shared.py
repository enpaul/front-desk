"""Internally shared database components

This submodule exists to avoid circular imports: architecturally there's no reason why
this module's base model and the :func:`initialize` function cannot both go in
``__init__``, or indeed why they can't both go here. However if both existed in the same
module then every other submodule would need to both import :class:`KeyoskBaseModel`
from that module, and be imported into that module for the :func:`initialize` function
to work. This would lead to a circular import.

Thus the :func:`initialize` function and :class:`KeyoskBaseModel` class need to go in
separate modules, and for somewhat arbitrary reasons the base model was put here and the
init function kept in init.
